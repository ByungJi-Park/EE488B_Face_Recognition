# Face embedding trainer

This repository contains the framework for training deep embeddings for face recognition. The trainer is intended for the face recognition exercise of the [EE488B Deep Learning for Visual Understanding](https://mm.kaist.ac.kr/teaching/) course. This is an adaptation of the [speaker recognition model trainer](https://github.com/clovaai/voxceleb_trainer).
